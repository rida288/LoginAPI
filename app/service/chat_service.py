    "- For questions about dataset schema (column names, row count, sample data), answer directly using the schema provided below without calling tools.\n"
    "- For math, averages, counts, unique categories/values (e.g. payment methods, customer types), calculations, or aggregations, call `execute_pandas_code` with a clean Python expression operating on `df` (e.g. `df['Method of Payment'].unique()`).\n"
